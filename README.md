# Calculator App

My solution to [Calculator App Challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/calculator-app-9lteq5N29).

This app was built with Webpack bundler, Esbuild and Typescript. The app has three themes and can be used to perform algebraic operations.

## Tested

- Win 10, Chrome v97, Firefox v95. 

## Ideas for improvement

- [ ] limit input numbers to avoid overflow errors;
- [ ] show buffer and pending operation right after an operation button pressed but the current number is still zero;
- [ ] keep selected theme in cookies;
- [ ] test for problems with a floating point.
